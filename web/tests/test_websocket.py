"""
Comprehensive WebSocket tests for Flask application.

This test suite follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
Tests are written FIRST to define expected behavior, then implementation follows.

Test Categories:
1. Connection Tests - Client connect/disconnect
2. Event Emission Tests - Stats, deployments, system status
3. Data Structure Tests - Validate event payloads
4. Broadcasting Tests - Multiple client updates
5. Integration Tests - Periodic updates, deployment workflow
