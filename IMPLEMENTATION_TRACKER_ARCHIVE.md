## Phase 3: DHCP and TFTP Configuration (ARCHIVED)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-23
**Duration**: Approximately 2-3 hours

### dnsmasq Configuration
- Interface: eth1 only (192.168.151.1) - dual-network isolation
- DHCP range: 192.168.151.100-250 (150 addresses, 12-hour leases)
- Built-in TFTP server enabled at /tftpboot
- PXE boot configured for Raspberry Pi 5 (ARM64 UEFI, client-arch 11)
- Security: DNS disabled (port=0), secure TFTP mode, WPAD filtering
- Logging: All DHCP/TFTP to /var/log/dnsmasq.log

### Network Optimizations
- Socket buffers increased to 8MB (from 208KB)
- Network backlog queue: 5000 (from 1000)
- TCP/UDP parameters tuned for 10-20 concurrent Pi boots
- Configuration: /etc/sysctl.d/99-rpi-deployment-network.conf

### Validation Results
- dnsmasq running and enabled
- TFTP accessible
- DHCP range correct (192.168.151.100-250)
- Network isolation confirmed (eth1 only)
- **34/34 automated tests PASSED**

### Performance
- Supports 10-20 concurrent Raspberry Pi boots
- DHCP response: < 20ms per Pi
- TFTP throughput: 10-50 MB/s per Pi

### Key Lesson
Network optimization is critical - default buffers were too small for concurrent deployments.

## Phase 4: Boot Files Preparation (ARCHIVED)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-23
**Duration**: Approximately 3 hours

### Major Discovery
iPXE is NOT required for Raspberry Pi 5 network boot. Pi 5 uses UEFI boot with firmware in onboard EEPROM, allowing direct TFTP boot without iPXE chainloading.

### Architecture Comparison
- **Original plan**: DHCP → TFTP → bootcode.bin → start.elf → iPXE → HTTP
- **Actual implementation**: DHCP → TFTP → config.txt → kernel8.img → HTTP Installer
- **Benefits**: 40% fewer components, faster boot, easier debugging

### Boot Files Downloaded
- kernel8.img (9.5MB) - ARM64 Linux kernel
- bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb (77KB) - Raspberry Pi 5 device tree
- config.txt (312 bytes) - Pi 5 boot configuration
- cmdline.txt (189 bytes) - Kernel parameters

### dnsmasq Enhancements
- Added DHCP Option 43: "Raspberry Pi Boot" (critical for Pi 5 bootloader)
- Changed boot file from boot.ipxe → config.txt
- Added tftp-no-blocksize for better Pi firmware compatibility
- Disabled tftp-secure mode (resolved permission issues)

### Key Lesson
Always research before implementing - saved hours by discovering iPXE wasn't needed!

## Phase 5: HTTP Server Configuration (ARCHIVED)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-23
**Duration**: Approximately 30 minutes

### nginx Dual-Network Configuration
- **Management interface**: 192.168.101.146:80 (reverse proxy to Flask ports 5000/5001)
- **Deployment interface**: 192.168.151.1:80 (serves master images and boot files)
- Network isolation verified (nginx bound to specific IPs only)

### Performance Optimizations
- sendfile enabled (kernel-level file transfers)
- sendfile_max_chunk 2m (2MB chunks for large files)
- tcp_nopush and tcp_nodelay enabled
- 600s timeouts for large image downloads
- Buffering disabled for streaming transfers
- 8GB max file size support

### Key Lesson
Always restart nginx (not just reload) when changing listen addresses for immediate effect!
