- [ ] Verify kernel boots and installer starts
- [ ] Test hostname assignment API (/api/config)
- [ ] Validate image download from HTTP server
- [ ] Confirm SD card write process

- **Test Venue**: Create "TEST" venue with test kart numbers

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Monitor DHCP/TFTP on deployment network
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 port 67 or port 68 or port 69

# Watch deployment logs in real-time
tail -f /opt/rpi-deployment/logs/deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status rpi-deployment rpi-web dnsmasq nginx

# View deployment history
sqlite3 /opt/rpi-deployment/database/deployment.db \
  "SELECT * FROM deployment_history ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Test API endpoints
curl http://192.168.151.1:5001/health
curl -X POST http://192.168.151.1:5001/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_type": "KXP2", "venue_code": "TEST", "serial_number": "12345678"}'

# Monitor web interface
http://192.168.101.146:5000
```
