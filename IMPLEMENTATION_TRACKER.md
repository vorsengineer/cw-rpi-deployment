- [‚úÖ] Downloaded Ubuntu 24.04 Server Cloud Image (596MB)
- [‚úÖ] Created comprehensive provisioning scripts with all fixes
- [‚úÖ] Resolved ALL critical technical issues:
  - Fixed display configuration (removed VGA, use default)
  - Fixed network config (DHCP on VLAN 101, not static)
  - Fixed DNS servers (single 8.8.8.8, not comma-separated)
  - Fixed SSH access (added SSH key and password auth)
  - Fixed Cloud-Init state persistence (purge disks on deletion)
  - Fixed SSH connection pooling (reuse connections)
  - Added QEMU guest agent installation
- [‚úÖ] Successfully provisioned VM with Cloud-Init automation
- [‚úÖ] Validated all services working

**Final Configuration**:

- **Resources**: 4 cores, 8GB RAM, 100GB disk
- **Storage**: vm_data pool
- **Cloud-Init**: Completed successfully
- **QEMU Guest Agent**: Installed and running

**SSH Access Methods**:
```bash
